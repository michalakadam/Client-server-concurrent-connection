# Client-server concurrent connection

### Motivation
This is an educational project developed during Java Academy during few pair-programming sessions with [Konrad Kusiak](https://github.com/Blysku). We focused on creating efficient connection between clients through server using Java sockets. To achieve that goal this application runs on multiple threads that were applied using java.util.concurrent library. 

### How to use this code
Object-oriented characteristic of this code makes it easy to reuse and extend to match specific implementation needs. 

##### Command-line steps:
1. Initialize empty folder and go to it:
*mkdir ClientServer*
*cd ClientServer*
2. Clone this repository to your machine:
*git clone https://github.com/michalakadam/Client-server-concurrent-connection.git*
3. Compile code using Maven (version 3.6.0 or higher)
*mvn clean install*
4. Explore the code!
